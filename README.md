solution--

To streamline the activities of College Events so we can create a single,
comprehensive form that includes all necessary information accessed with the
help of QR code. The form should be easy to access and use, with clear
instructions and prompts for required fields. We can also use technology to
automate the process and reduce the need for manual data entry.
The form can be modified to generate forms for different events.
DataBase implemented can directly generate different certificates to be
mailed to registered e-mail ids.
